 hello ,this is my first blog,welcome!
 理解通货膨胀
 2003年：啤酒1.5元/瓶，100元可购买66瓶啤酒； 2003-2013年：100元按照年化3%的年化收益率进行理财，10年后100元变成了134元。 2013年：啤酒3.5元/瓶，134元仅可购买38瓶啤酒  虽然你懂点理财，且你的钱变多了，但是钱的购买力下降了
养老有哪些解决方案：
靠国家&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;社保-养老保险（社保的一部分-统筹养老保险） 养老保险基金改革，延迟退休年龄，个人账户入不敷出、退休员工越来越多，高退休金体制内领取人越来越多
靠企业&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;企业年金（只有好企业才会有的福利）
靠自己&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;储、理财、投资、商业养老保险
靠自己才是硬道理。。。</description>

      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>
